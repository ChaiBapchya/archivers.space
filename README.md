## About the Project

Thank you for your interest in DataRescue activites, you can learn more from the [DataRefuge project](http://www.ppehlab.org/) and [EDGI](https://envirodatagov.org/).

The code for the archivers app is currently in a protected repo while we complete a security audit, but we are moving the [issue queue](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/archivers.space/issues) to this public repository so that event organizers and participants can provide feedback, report bugs, and request features.
