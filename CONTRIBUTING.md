# Contribution Guidelines

We love improvements to our tools! EDGI has general [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to all of our organizational repos.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the project, please check out the [issue queue](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/archivers.space/issues) for some ideas about what needs to be done.

## Installation

To run the application locally, you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install). With those in hand, cd into your clone of the repo and run `meteor npm install` to download dependencies. Then run `meteor run` to start the app, which you should be able to visit in a browser by going to `http://localhost:3000/`. Log in as "root"/"change_this_password_right_now" and you're in business.

## Getting Oriented

We have a [code walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/v-1nrXCIHn8) to help you get familiar with the codebase. The file structure has changed slightly since this video was recorded but the concepts are the same.
